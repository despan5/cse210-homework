This Weather app has a simple menu to use it. Select the option from 1-4 to display the current weather, daily forecast, and a 3 day forecast. 
If desired, the user can change all of the measurement from Metric to Imperial by switching the c to f or kph to mph in the APP file under the WeatherForecastApp class. 
These variables are in the DisplayCurrentWeather, DisplayDailyForecast, and Display3DayForecast methods in that class. The File that the weather information is being
pulled from is the weatherinfo.json file. If you want current weather info you can download a new json file from WeatherAPI.com and create a free account.
Thanks for checking out my app!
